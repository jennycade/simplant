#Welcome to Pixel Plant!

It's spring, and your pixel plant seed has just sprouted.

As a plant, you need to soak up ☀️ sunlight from your shoots and 💧 water from your roots to store ⚡️ energy in the form of sugar.

Use stored ⚡️energy to grow, bloom new 🌸 flowers, and make those flowers form 🍓 fruits and disperse 🌰 seeds.

How many 🌰 seeds can you disperse before the end of the growing season in 200 days?

HINTS

* Click on ☀️ sunlight when it hits leaves and 💧 water when it hits roots.
* Making a new shoot or new root makes a new branch point on the plant. Grow the shoots or roots to grow from that branch.
